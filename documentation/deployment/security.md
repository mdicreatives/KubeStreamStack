# Security Guide

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for deploying and operating KubeStreamStack.

## 1. Network Security

*   **Isolate Components**: Ensure that Kubernetes network policies are configured to restrict communication between components to only what is necessary.
*   **Ingress/Egress Control**: Limit external access to only required services (e.g., Airflow UI, Kafka UI) using Ingress controllers and appropriate firewall rules.
*   **TLS/SSL**: Enable TLS/SSL for all inter-component communication (Kafka, Flink, Airflow) and for external access to UIs.

## 2. Authentication and Authorization

*   **Airflow**: Configure strong authentication for the Airflow UI (e.g., LDAP, OAuth, or a robust password policy for database authentication). Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit user permissions.
*   **Kafka**: Utilize Kafka's built-in authentication mechanisms (e.g., SASL) and authorization (ACLs) to control access to topics.
*   **Kubernetes RBAC**: Apply least privilege principles for Kubernetes service accounts used by the platform components.

## 3. Data Security

*   **Encryption at Rest**: Ensure data stored in PostgreSQL (Airflow metadata) and Kafka logs is encrypted at rest. This typically involves configuring the underlying storage solution (e.g., Kubernetes Persistent Volumes with encryption).
*   **Encryption in Transit**: As mentioned in network security, use TLS/SSL for all data in transit.

## 4. Vulnerability Management

*   **Regular Updates**: Keep all platform components (Kafka, Flink, Airflow, Kubernetes, Helm charts) updated to their latest stable versions to benefit from security patches.
*   **Image Scanning**: Use container image scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities in your Docker images.

## 5. Logging and Monitoring

*   **Centralized Logging**: Implement a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus/Grafana) to collect logs from all components for security auditing and incident response.
*   **Alerting**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities, failed login attempts, or unusual resource consumption patterns.

## 6. Secrets Management

*   **Kubernetes Secrets**: Use Kubernetes Secrets to store sensitive information (e.g., database passwords, API keys) and avoid hardcoding them in configurations or source code.
*   **External Secret Stores**: For more advanced scenarios, consider integrating with external secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault.
