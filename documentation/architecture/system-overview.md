# System Overview

## Architecture Overview

The Streaming Platform is designed to provide a complete solution for real-time data processing applications. The system is built on Kubernetes and uses several key components to handle data ingestion, processing, and storage.

## Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Apache Kafka**: Handles real-time data ingestion
  - Configurable topics
  - Scalable partitions
  - High availability

### 2. Processing Layer
- **Apache Flink**: Stream processing engine
  - Real-time data processing
  - State management
  - Fault tolerance

### 3. Orchestration Layer
- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow management
  - Scheduled data processing
  - Data pipeline orchestration
  - Error handling and retries

### 4. Storage Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Metadata storage
  - Airflow metadata
  - System configuration
  - Processed data storage

### 5. Monitoring Layer
- **Kafka UI**: Kafka monitoring
- **Flink UI**: Flink job monitoring
- **Airflow UI**: Workflow monitoring

## Data Flow

1. Data is ingested through Kafka
2. Flink processes the data in real-time
3. Processed data is stored and made available for analysis
4. Airflow orchestrates periodic data processing tasks

## System Requirements

- Kubernetes cluster (Minikube for development)
- Sufficient CPU and memory resources
- Network connectivity between components
- Storage for persistent data

## Security Considerations

- Network policies between components
- Authentication for UI access
- Data encryption in transit
- Secure storage of credentials

## Scalability

The system is designed to scale horizontally:
- Kafka topics can be partitioned
- Flink jobs can be scaled
- Airflow workers can be increased
- Storage can be expanded

## Integration Points

The platform provides several integration points for custom applications:
- Kafka topics for data ingestion
- Flink job submission interface
- Airflow DAG API
- Monitoring APIs

## Future Components

The platform is designed to be extensible. Future components may include:
- Elasticsearch for log aggregation
- Grafana for metrics visualization
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Redis for caching
- Additional message brokers
